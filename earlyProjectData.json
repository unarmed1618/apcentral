{"label":"Midi-Controlled Floppy Disk Organ", "content": "Because I'm ambitious, for my Electromechanical Systems Design project I decided to try to create a musical instrument out of floppy disk drives and a microcontroller. This was prior to any programming experience, so everything I did, I learned on my own. The actual method is this: A floppy drive's read motor is very loud, and can be controlled directly via digital signal. I wrote a bit of programming to make an Arduino microcontroller generate the necessary digital signals to 'drive' the floppy drives, and added some electronics to make the arduino able to read MIDI-style note information. Many projects like this exist, but this was to my knowledge, one of the earliest ones that actually generates music live rather than plays music from a 'reel' like a player-piano. I was very proud of this project.", "link":"/","linkdesc":"Home"},
{"label":"Zero-Budget Transit Tracking Aggregator","content":"During my time as an Engineering student at East Carolina University, I was asked to join a small team of two engineering students to find a way to track the usage of ECU's Bus system. The current method proposed was to have students ride busses and record the number of passengers at any given time on paper, and then hand in all of the papers to us, and we would enter them. I decided to try to make a way to do this without paper. We had zero budget, so my resources were extremely limited. The method I devised was to have students sign up for Twitter accounts with their cell phones, use Twitter's SMS protocol to send in data chunks of the type- 36 passengers aboard at point n, time t. I used another twitter account to subscribe to all of the other accounts in order to centralize the data, and used a CURL script along with some regular expressions to transform the data from twitter's XML to an XML that I could use with Excel. I used Excel scripts to generate statistics from that. Zero-budget data mining using cell phones and social networking.","link":"/","linkdesc":"Home"}
